Zend partials with modules
==========================

Introduction
------------
This application is built on top of git://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication.git

The main idea of the application is to feed partials with data from various modules so you can aggregate data from one module in another module keeping modules code in their appropriate folders as they should be.

In this particular case you place a widget from the Chart2 module in the bottom panel that shows data related or unrelated (either you like) to the article in the top panel that comes from the 'Application' module

Installation
------------
Install just as you would install the skeleton application

git clone https://github.com/konradst/zend-cross-module-content.git
